This is a fork of https://github.com/axieum/authme/ that supports multiple accounts \
It also saves the refresh tokens so you don't have to keep authorizing it... \
You need to set up a CLIENT_ID though, I don't recommend using the original mod's one.

# This wouldn't even have been considered if it wasn't for axieum with his original project ALL CREDIT GOES TO HIM.

# TODO
1. Get better button textures for the user selection menu.
2. Encrypt Refresh Tokens
