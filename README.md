This is a fork of https://github.com/axieum/authme/ that supports multiple accounts. \
It also saves the refresh tokens so you don't have to keep authorizing it. \
You need to set up a CLIENT_ID though, I don't recommend using the original mod's one. \
This project is currently non-functional, it's very INDEV. Also, not to mention the security issues with storing refresh tokens in plain text.

# This wouldn't even have been considered if it wasn't for axieum with his original project ALL CREDIT GOES TO HIM.

# TODO
1. Get better button textures for the user selection menu.
2. Encrypt Refresh Tokens
3. Save secrets periodically, not just on startup/shutdown
