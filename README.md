This is a fork of https://github.com/axieum/authme/ that supports multiple accounts \
It also saves the credentials so you don't have to keep authorizing it... \
It is not complete so do not use it and it still uses the original azure app thing so I also need to change that \
but first I want to get to know a bit of the codebase \
I might never develop this because of azure app non-sense so yeah. \
# This wouldn't even have been considered if it wasn't for axieum with his original project ALL CREDIT GOES TO HIM.

# TODO
1. Get better button textures for the user selection menu.
2. Encrypt Refresh Tokens
